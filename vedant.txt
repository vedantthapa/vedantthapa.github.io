Hello WorldðŸ‘‹ I am Vedant Thapa!<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag -->
<div class="center-justified">
I'm currently working as a Data Scientist @ Statistics Canada. 

I recently graduated from Saint Mary's University, Halifax with a Master's degree in Computing and Data Analytics. Previously, I've worked as Data Analyst Intern at multiple start-ups wherein my primary role was to surf datasets quickly, encountering and surfacing potential insights. Also, present this information to the stakeholders using effective plots to allow the mind to extract details faster.

I enjoy spending most of my time competing in hackathons related to Machine / Deep learning, other times I play soccer or improve my chess ratings. In short, I do a bunch of things: ML, Computer Vision, reading, contemplating, you get the idea.

Apart from English, I speak Python and I've compeleted few projects.<br> Do you wanna have a look?<a href="/projects"> Here you go</a>.
